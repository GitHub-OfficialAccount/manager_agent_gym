"""
💬 Basic Agent Communication & Coordination

This example demonstrates how agents communicate and coordinate within workflows:
1. Creating multiple agents (AI and simulated human)
2. Setting up the communication system
3. Showing agents sending direct messages and broadcasts
4. Demonstrating message history and thread organization
5. Observing coordination patterns during task execution

This showcases the foundation for multi-agent collaboration!
