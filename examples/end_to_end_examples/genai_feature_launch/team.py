Gen-AI Feature Launch Demo

Real-world use case: User-facing generative AI feature launch with safety gates and governance.

Demonstrates:
- Complex multi-stakeholder coordination across AI safety, privacy, security, and regulatory compliance domains
- Risk-driven project management with safety-first prioritization and gate-based approval workflows
- High-stakes decision making under regulatory scrutiny with audit-ready documentation requirements
- Crisis-ready deployment planning with real-time monitoring, kill switches, and incident response capabilities
- Cross-functional team leadership managing technical specialists, legal counsel, and executive stakeholders
- Regulatory compliance management across data protection, AI transparency, and safety disclosure requirements
- Timeline-critical delivery under 6-week constraint with safety-first scope management and controlled rollout strategies
