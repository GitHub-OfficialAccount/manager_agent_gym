Pharmaceutical Product Launch Demo

Real-world use case: Global pharmaceutical company launching new drug product.

Demonstrates:
- Sequential dependency management across 9 interconnected regulatory and manufacturing phases
- Safety-critical decision prioritization when regulatory compliance conflicts with commercial timelines
- Multi-stakeholder coordination across highly specialized domains (regulatory, quality, manufacturing, commercial)
- Long-horizon strategic planning with 10+ week critical path and complex approval gates
- Risk escalation and mitigation when patient safety signals or manufacturing deficiencies emerge
- Resource reallocation under strict regulatory constraints and budget pressures
