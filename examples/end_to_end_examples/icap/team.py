"""
ICAAP (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process) Demo

Real-world use case: Mid-size EU retail bank annual ICAAP cycle.

Demonstrates:
- Hierarchical task decomposition for ICAAP phases
- Preference dynamics emphasizing compliance near submission
- Ad hoc team coordination with human sign-offs
- Governance-by-design validation rules (LLM-based rubrics)
